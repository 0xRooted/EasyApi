# Easy Api

<b>
Made in c++ for creating apis.
------------------------------
<h1>Why I made this?</h1>
A: I used flask in python to make my apis but I always wanted to make something to use in c++ so then I started to work on easy api a light weight c++ api library that can be used for most use cases.
<h1>Will this project be improved?</h1>
A: Yes I will be updating easy api with alot of useful features such as making the process easier to use. Easy Api will also have new features implemented such as reload process when code has been changed the easy api watcher will recompile, kill the process, and run. Well the last option might just be fully changed I will make a custom syntax language that you will be able to write your handler functions in and by changing them you wont need to recompile.
<h1>How do I port this into my project?</h1>
A: Simply git clone the current repository and look at the main.cpp for an example of how to create endpoints for your api and how to return responses.
<h1>How to compile the project</h1>
A: Currently EasyApi is only linux the only library that needs to be linked or compiled is pthread which can be done with the g++ flag -lpthread
